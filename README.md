pySurf provides a wide range of geometric operations for triangulated surfaces and piecewise linear curves, including computing intersections between components.
These operations are differentiated using AD, which enables their use in gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization.

**Note: The hyperbolic collar mesh generation functionality has been deprecated since v1.2.0.**
